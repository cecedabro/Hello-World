# Hello-World
This repository is for learning the GitHub Flow

Hi! My name is CÃ©dric and this is my first real attempt at learning Git.
I have experience in Python and am currently re-learning it so I can build
actual projects with it. Next year I'll start my HBO ICT-software engineering
at the HVA. My long term vision is building projects and finding enough
remote work to live decently and independently in a nice house in rural
France. I hope that my passion for coding and alligned vision will allow
me to one day look back on this moment and think to myself:
"Thats where it all began"
